An experimental logical fallacy lookup tool built atop [React Static Starter Kit](https://github.com/andrewscwei/react-static-starter-kit), staticly hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and content managed by [Prismic](https://prismic.io).

Fallacy descriptions, examples and other definitions are sourced from [The Fallacy Files](https://www.fallacyfiles.org/), [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://www.iep.utm.edu/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org). They are rearranged for presentation clarity and language consistency. Full credits go to the respective authors of these sources.

```

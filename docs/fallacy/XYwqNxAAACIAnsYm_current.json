In addition, celebrities publicly espouse every political, religious, and charitable cause, and some has-beens build second careers in the public eye as spokespeople for causes.",

These were not real doctors, but make-believe ones, who did not have real medical expertise, just make-believe expertise.\nOf course, sports celebrities often endorse athletic shoes and other equipment, and it is at least plausible that they have expertise with these products.
